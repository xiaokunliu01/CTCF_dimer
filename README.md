# CTCF_dimer
This repository contains all scripts used to generate the figures for the CTCF dimer paper. Specifically, it include:  
1. Scripts for aligning Footprint-C and spDamID-seq datasets (Alignment scripts for HiChIP and re-HiChIP are identical to those for Footprint-C).  
2. Sripts for generating figures, numbered according to their corresponding figure labels in the main text (Fig) and supplementary materials (FigS).

Note: Many of the required R and Python libraries are not included in the provided scripts and must be installed separately.
