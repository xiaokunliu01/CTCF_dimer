# CTCF_dimer
This repository contains all scripts I used to generate the relevant figures for the CTCF dimer paper. Specifically, it include:  
1. Scripts for alignment of Footprint-C and spDamID-seq data.  
2. Sripts for figures, and scripts are numbered by figure numbers in main text (Fig) and supplementary data (figS).
Note: Many libraries used by these scripts are not included in the setup files and must be installed separately in R or Python.
